# Justin's Reflections and Thoughts

### This lab taught me alot. It taught me:

1. How splunk works and using SPL to filter your logs and get what you need.
2. Setting up Splunk, forwarders and sysmon add-ons.
3. Gain more fimmiliarity with command line interfaces by using Ubuntu Server 22.04
4. First time using Hydra and Atomic Red Team.
5. How virtual machines communicate in a bridged adapter network
6. Writing up a document in github, very fimmiliar to using HTML/CSS.
7. Understand what syslog and auth.log logs in Ubuntu.
8. Understand Application, Security and Sysmon logs in Windows.
9. Eventcode 4688 in Windows security logs.

### Conclusion
I learned alot. I'm glad I pushed myself to pursue this experience. 

#### Future Plans
I want to do some volunteering for the Electronic Recycle Association to gain hands on experience with hardware and how electronics are salvaged and recycled. Also, 24 hours of volunteering gets you a laptop/desktop. 
While receiving my daily rejection emails from various industries, one expert in the industry was kind enough to give me some advice. I was really touched by his kindness. Even if it can't help me immediately, it gave me some hope so I will keep purusing this whole ordeal. I mean, surely my efforts will pay off in the end right? Only time will tell...

My next lab will be to build a Server 2022 active directory, setup a DC, Remote Desktop Server, setup a trial m365 account, enable redirected folders, create many accounts setup file permissions, test them and consider how I'd want to setup 
an office environment for a hypothetical.
